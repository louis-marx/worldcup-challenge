# Predicting FIFA World Cup 2022

This project is the work of Maxime Dolphin, ChloÃ© Novis and Louis Marx. It is part of an internal challenge at PwC Belgium and aims at predicting the results of the 2022 soccer world cup. To do so, a database was provided to us by the organizers of the challenge.This database contained the list of all international soccer matches since 1993 with a number of variables related to:
- The teams that played each other such as their country, their FIFA rank and points as well as several scores to evaluate the strength of their goalkeeper, defense, midfield and offense.
- The context of the match such as the tournament, the country and the city in which it takes place
- The result of the match including the score, the shoot outs and the winner

Our approach to this challenge was as follows:
- Our database is tailored to predict the outcome of a given match, not the tournament outcome directly.
- To predict the outcome of the tournament, we will predict the outcome of each of the games that make up the tournament.
- Developing a model that predicts both scores simultaneously is beyond our capabilities.
- Given the time constraints and the fact that this work is done in our spare time, it is better to stick to what we know.
- For a given game, we will predict each score individually (and therefore independently of each other).
- In a tournament, a small variation of score at the beginning can have a big impact on the result at the end. Our result should reflect this variance.
- Predicting a single result per game will lead to a single tournament outcome and therefore will not reflect the impact of this variance.
- We will therefore not simulate a single tournament but several in which some randomness will be introduced.
- The aggregation of all these simulations will give us probabilities for each team to reach each stage of the tournament.

## Data

### Data Transformation

We had to reconfigure the dataset so as to be able to study the performance at team-level for each game, as opposed to studying the outcome at game-level.

| Date      | home_team | away_team | home_team_fifa_rank | away_team_fifa_rank | home_team_score | away_team_score | tournament     | neutral_location |
| --------- | --------- | --------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | --------------- | --------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| 7/10/2018 | France    | Belgium   | 2                   | 5                   | 1               | 0               | FIFA World Cup | TRUE             |

Transformed into

| Date      | team    | opponent | fifa_rank_difference | team_score | tournament     | team_hosting | opponent_hosting |
| --------- | ------- | -------- | -------------------- | ---------- | -------------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| 7/10/2018 | France  | Belgium  | 3                    | 1          | FIFA World Cup | False        | False            |
| 7/10/2018 | Belgium | France   | -3                   | 0          | FIFA World Cup | False        | False            |

### Data Cleaning

We cleaned the dataset that we had by selecting the rows in which the teams taking part in the 2022 World Cup were represented (32 teams) + a bunch of other high-qualityteams that will not play in the World Cup but that can still be relevant to train our prediction model. The goal was to avoid having low-end teams shaping our model.

RandomForest models allow for up to 53 possibilities for one variables, so we could keep 21 extra teams. The selected teams are in [countries_selection.csv](data-raw/countries_selection.csv).

### Data Preparation

As performance indicators for the prevision of goals, we chose to keep the goalkeeper, defense, midfield and offense scores alredy present in the dataset and to add additional indicators such as stars (= how many World Cups had the team won at the moment of the game) and hapiness index of the team's country at the time of the game. Some teams' scores were missing so we took the computation method from Kaggle and added them ourselves.

## Modelling

### Random Forest 

To model the number of goals a team scores in a given match, we decided to use a Random Forest for several reasons:
- Within the team, we were all comfortable with this method which gave us more time to tune it properly.
- We did not want to make any assumption of linearity between the predictors and the number of goals.
- We thought that this method would be easier to explain to a public not necessarily initiated.
- In view of the large number of qualitative predictors and their large number of different values, we thought that decision trees would handle them more easily.

### Variable Importance

## Simulation

To simulate world cups, we have chosen an object-oriented approach. Starting by creating a class to represent a team, we progressively made our simulation more complex by creating matches, then groups and knockout phases, until we were able to model an entire tournament. The few points of attention were to algorithmically reproduce the FIFA logic to break ties within the groups and the distribution of teams at the beginning of the knockout phase. In our simulations, the scores of the games were simulated using the results of our predictive model.

Of course our predictive model does not give us integer scores. For example the predicted score for Belgium against Argentina is 1.4 goals. This is not a problem since we intended to introduce a random dimension between the prediction of our model and the scores of our simulations. In fact, we use the prediction of our model as a parameter of a probability distribution in which the scores are drawn. We have chosen a Poisson distribution. It is particularly adapted in our case because it is discrete and its lambda parameter corresponds to its mean. In other words, it wonderfully represents a score and on average, the scores drawn corresponds to the one predicted by our model.

### Most Probable Outcomes

In addition, there is a report class that keeps track of the simulation results in order to give overall statistics. In fact, it counts the number of times each team manages to reach each phase during the simulations. By dividing these counts by the number of simulations, we obtain a percentage which we consider as the chance that a team reaches each phase. For example, if in 100 simulations Portugal reaches the quarter-finals 42 times, then Portugal is considered to have a 42% chance of reaching the quarter-finals.

To conclude, we wanted to represent the most probable outcome of the 2022 World Cup according to our model. For this, for each match, the predicted score is converted into an integer by taking the score that has the highest probability in the corresponding Poisson distribution. Of course, the scores are then averages and the results of the matches are very often 1-1. To break ties in the knockout phase and simulate shootouts, the team with the higher predicted score in our model wins the match.
